# Project-2-Analyzing-Chipotle-Data
For Project 2, you will complete a series of exercises exploring order data from Chipotle, compliments of The New York Times' "The Upshot."  For these exercises, you will conduct basic exploratory data analysis (Pandas not required) to understand the essentials of Chipotle's order data: how many orders are being made, the average price per order, how many different ingredients are used, etc. These allow you to practice business analysis skills while also becoming comfortable with Python.
